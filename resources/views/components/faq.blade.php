    <dl>
      <dt>Will you sell my email address or send me a newsletter?</dt>
      <dd>Ew, no. It’s for confirming feed ownership and sending notifications.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>What if I decide I don’t like this?</dt>
      <dd>Your feed confirmation email and every notification include a link back here you can use to delete the monitor. If you add a feed you don’t confirm within a few days, it’ll be deleted automatically.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>How often are feeds checked?</dt>
      <dd>Every ten minutes or so, which I may have to adjust if this gets busy enough. At minimum, they should be checked at least once a day.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>How many feeds can I add?</dt>
      <dd>As many as you want! Please make sure they’re yours though. We’re on the honor system, and I reserve the right to reach out about anything questionable or remove submissions that seem spammy.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Why did you make this?</dt>
      <dd>I love RSS and manage to break my feeds a lot. If you’re here then maybe you’re in the same boat—so I made this little app for both of us.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>What if this site gets crushed by people eager to monitor feeds?</dt>
      <dd>Good, I guess? I’ll do a better job of leaving notes here and do what I can to keep it useful.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Are you working on AI features for this?</dt>
      <dd>No.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Can I look at the source code to make sure you’re not doing anything gross?</dt>
      <dd><a href="https://github.com/mattstein/feed-canary">Right this way</a>!</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Is there an updates page that ironically does not have an RSS feed?</dt>
      <dd><a href="/updates">Yes</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>What if I have a problem or another question?</dt>
      <dd><a href="mailto:matts@omg.lol">Send me an email</a>, please! I’d love to hear from you.</dd>
